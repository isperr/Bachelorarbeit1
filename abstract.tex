This paper will give insights into the viewing behavior of a person using the internet in particular search engines. In order to better understand how a user is viewing a search engine result page (SERP), an eye tracking device can be installed to record the user's eye movements \autocite{liu2015influence}. 
Therefore, it is a necessity to take a closer look at the most relevant eye tracking technologies, parameters and visualization methods. In addition, this paper focuses on SERPs, how these are built and how the user captures and processes the presented information on there.
To provide a better understanding of how search engine result pages are assembled, the structure will be explained on an example of a modern search engine. Furthermore, there will be a comparison of modern commercial search engines, which emphasizes the advantages and disadvantages of the SERP structure.
Only when those requirements are met, a search engine result page can be improved and accordingly adjusted for the user to maximize the efficiency of the information retrieval.
